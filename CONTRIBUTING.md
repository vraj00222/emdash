# Contributing to Emdash

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We favor small, focused PRs and clear intent over big bangs. This guide explains how to get set up, the workflow we use, and a few project‑specific conventions.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24.0.0+ (recommended: 24.14.0)**, **pnpm 10.28.0+**, and Git
- Optional (recommended for end‑to‑end testing):
  - GitHub CLI (`brew install gh`; then `gh auth login`)
  - At least one supported coding agent CLI (see docs for list)

Setup

```bash
# Fork this repo, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<you>/emdash.git
cd emdash

# Use the correct Node.js version (if using nvm)
nvm use

# Quick start: install dependencies and run dev server
pnpm run d

# Or run separately:
pnpm install
pnpm run dev

# Format, lint, type check, and test
pnpm run format
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test
```

Tip: During development, the renderer hot‑reloads. Changes to the Electron main process (files in `src/main`) require a restart of the dev app.

## Project Overview

- `src/main/` – Electron main process, IPC handlers, services (Git, worktrees, PTY manager, DB, etc.)
- `src/renderer/` – React UI (Vite), hooks, components
- Local database – SQLite file created under the OS userData folder (see "Local DB" below)
- Worktrees – Git worktrees are created outside your repo root in a sibling `worktrees/` folder
- Logs – Agent terminal output and app logs are written to the OS userData folder (not inside repos)

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch

```
 git checkout -b feat/<short-slug>
```

2. Make changes and keep PRs small and focused

- Prefer a series of small PRs over one large one.
- Include UI screenshots/GIFs when modifying the interface.
- Update docs (README or inline help) when behavior changes.

3. Run checks locally

```
pnpm run format     # Format code with Prettier (required)
pnpm run lint       # ESLint
pnpm run typecheck  # TypeScript type checking
pnpm run test       # Vitest test suite
```

Pre-commit hooks run automatically via Husky + lint-staged. On each commit, staged files are auto-formatted with Prettier and linted with ESLint. Run the full local gate before opening or merging a PR.

If you need to skip the hook for a work-in-progress commit, use `git commit --no-verify`. The checks will still run in CI when you open a PR.

4. Commit using Conventional Commits

- `feat:` – new user‑facing capability
- `fix:` – bug fix
- `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `perf:`, `test:` etc.

Examples

```
fix(opencode): change initialPromptFlag from -p to --prompt for TUI

feat(docs): add changelog tab with GitHub releases integration
```

5. Open a Pull Request

- Describe the change, rationale, and testing steps.
- Link related Issues.
- Keep the PR title in Conventional Commit format if possible.

## Code Style and Patterns

TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier

Pre-commit hooks handle formatting and linting automatically on staged files. For full-project checks you can run them manually:

- `pnpm run format` -- format all files with Prettier
- `pnpm run lint` -- ESLint across all files
- `pnpm run typecheck` -- TypeScript type checking (whole project)
- `pnpm run test` -- run the test suite

Electron main (Node side)

- Prefer `execFile` over `exec` to avoid shell quoting issues.
- Never write logs into Git worktrees. All logs belong in the Electron `userData` folder.
- Be conservative with console logging; noisy logs reduce signal. Use clear prefixes.

Git and worktrees

- The app creates worktrees in a sibling `../worktrees/` folder.
- Do not delete worktree folders from Finder/Explorer; if you need cleanup, use:
  - `git worktree prune` (from the main repo)
  - or the in‑app workspace removal

Renderer (React)

- Components live under `src/renderer/components`; hooks under `src/renderer/hooks`.
- Agent CLIs are embedded via terminal emulation (xterm.js) - each agent runs in its own PTY.
- Use existing UI primitives and Tailwind utility classes for consistency.
- Aim for accessible elements (labels, `aria-*` where appropriate).

Local DB (SQLite)

- Location (Electron `app.getPath('userData')`):
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/emdash/emdash.db`
  - Linux: `~/.config/emdash/emdash.db`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\emdash\emdash.db`
- Reset: quit the app, delete the file, relaunch (the schema is recreated).

## Issue Reports and Feature Requests

- Use GitHub Issues. Include:
  - OS, Node version
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Relevant logs (renderer console, terminal output)
  - Screenshots/GIFs for UI issues

## Release Process (maintainers)

Use pnpm's built-in versioning to ensure consistency:

```bash
# For bug fixes (0.2.9 → 0.2.10)
pnpm version patch

# For new features (0.2.9 → 0.3.0)
pnpm version minor

# For breaking changes (0.2.9 → 1.0.0)
pnpm version major
```

This automatically:

1. Updates `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`
2. Creates a git commit with the version number (e.g., `"0.2.10"`)
3. Creates a git tag (e.g., `v0.2.10`)

Then push the commit and tag. Production release builds are dispatched from GitHub Actions.

### What happens next

The release pipeline is split across these GitHub Actions workflows:

**Production Release** (`.github/workflows/release-prod.yml`):
1. Builds Linux, Windows, and macOS packages
2. Signs Windows builds when Azure Trusted Signing secrets are configured
3. Signs, verifies, notarizes, and staples macOS DMGs and ZIPs
4. Uploads release artifacts to Cloudflare R2

**Linux/Nix Build** (`.github/workflows/nix-build.yml`):
1. Computes the correct dependency hash from `pnpm-lock.yaml`
2. Builds the x86_64-linux package via Nix flake
3. Pushes build artifacts to Cachix and uploads the Nix artifact when available

**Canary Release** (`.github/workflows/release-canary.yml`):
1. Builds Linux, Windows, and macOS packages with the canary config
2. Publishes artifacts to the `v1-canary` R2 channel
